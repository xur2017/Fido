### Introduction
  Team Fido will be creating a responsive web application aimed at uniting potential pet
parents with animals in shelters who match their lifestyle needs, while also providing a way for a
shelter to display their adoptable animals in a fun, social way on our website, Finding Fido . Our
team will use this project opportunity to learn web application development from start to finish,
including the use of the Django framework and Model-View-Template architecture.

### Description of Program from the User’s Perspective
  Our program will have two different sets of users: shelters who are advertising their
animals to be adopted, and adopters (pet parents) who are searching for the perfect pet to
match their lifestyle. These users will have two different perspectives and sets of features
available to them to match their needs.
  Shelters will be able to create an account that allows them to create adoptable pet
profiles. These profiles will include: type of animal, breed, disposition, availability, status,
description, and an image. The shelter may upload multiple pictures if they would like, and will
also have their own splash page with information specifically about the shelter, including
address and contact information. When the shelter updates a pet’s status, it will send it to the
daily feed on the home screen, making it more visible to potential pet parents.
  Adoptive Pet Parents will be able to create a separate type of user account that allows
them to search for animals based on type, breed, disposition, or date created. These users are
also able to browse profiles and view shelter information. They can sign up for email
notifications when a pet that matches their criteria is added to the site. If they find a pet that
they like, they can add it to their favorites list.
